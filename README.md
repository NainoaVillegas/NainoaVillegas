### About Me
👋 I'm Nainoa Villegas, a passionate Full Stack Developer based in the Greater Seattle Area but I'm originally from Hawai'i. My mission is to inspire the youth of Hawai'i, especially those from challenging backgrounds, to reach for the stars and strive for success. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for transformation, and I'm dedicated to creating opportunities for others.

🌟 Here are some key aspects of who I am and what I do:

- 💻 I specialize in creating web applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. However, I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies.
- 🛠️ Currently, I'm actively involved in the freelancing space, where I work closely with local Hawaiian and family businesses to build customized applications that help them thrive in the digital age.
- 🌺 I'm a Native Hawaiian, and my work is deeply rooted in my culture and community. I'm committed to preserving and sharing the rich heritage of the Hawaiian Islands through technology.

### My Tech Stack
🚀 Here are some of the technologies I love to work with:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, NextJS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Python
- Databases: MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, VS Code, Figma, CLI
